#### My Awards & Academic achievments
##### ML Stepik certifiacte
* This diploma was acquired for Stepik Machine Learning introductionary course by carpov.courses team. Here I just acquired some preliminary skills, like what's the ML for, which tools are essential and whate are Decision Trees and Random Forests models about, including the metrics calc and hyperparameters search techniques. Likewise, the pandas & sklearn packages were studied
##### Netology Neural Networks Implementation Intensive
* Basic approaches of NN and AI were analyzed and implemented. Nothing groundbreaking...
##### Yandex Algorithms November Training Session
* Certificate for competetive programming challenges. Bunch of Algorithms were studied and trained such as Strings processing, Graphs processing (Dijkstra Algorithm), Enumerating algorithms and arrays sorting techniques.
